## About This Project

I've been maintaining a local conversion of the documentation in Gitea's wiki format for a couple of years now, mostly using an automated tool.
This time I'm doing it manually, from scratch, as I want it to be more cohesive with links between the context methods and enums and so forth.

For more information, check the PROJECT ROADMAP and STATUS issues.
