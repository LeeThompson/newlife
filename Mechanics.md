# Game Mechanics

Newlife employs a number of game mechanics that are largely in the background.

## Arousal

## Alcohol

## Clothing

Clothing is handled by having "slots" available on the character.

| Slot | PC | Male NPC | Female NPC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Upper Body | Yes | Jacket |  Yes |
| Lower Body | Yes | Trousers | Yes |
| Underwear Upper Body | Yes | Shirt | Yes |
| Underwear Lower Body | Yes | No  |  Yes |
| Legwear | Yes | No | Yes |


### Wardrobe

## Enjoyment

Enjoyment is a system used to track how much a character is enjoying themselves or another's company.   It is used to develop *relationships* and as well as *stress*.

**NOTES:**
- Newlife scene developers should increase enjoyment when the character does something that makes them happy, and decrease it when something is making them unhappy.
- There are variants to the methods used to alter enjoyment levels, some are for if another character NPC is involved.
- Methods that do not involve another character primarily affect *stress* levels rather than *relationships*.

### Children

Children in newlife exist as "babies" that are essentially always "off-screen".   They are stored as an object "attached" to the PC or a Female NPC.

**NOTES:**
- If a game is set to play for longer than the default of 52 weeks, babies will never grow up and will always be treated as infants.
