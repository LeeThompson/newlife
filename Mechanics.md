## Enjoyment

Enjoyment is a system used to track how much a character is enjoying themselves or another's company.   It is used to develop *relationships* and as well as *stress*.

**NOTES:**
- Newlife scene developers should increase enjoyment when the character does something that makes them happy, and decrease it when something is making them unhappy.
- There are variants to the methods used to alter enjoyment levels, some are for if another character NPC is involved.
- Methods that do not involve another character primarily affect *stress* levels rather than *relationships*.
