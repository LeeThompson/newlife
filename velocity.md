# Introduction

Velocity is a template language developed by Java, primarily for dynamic web content.  Although it has been *depreciated* since 2021, documentation and source code is available at the time of this writing (November 2023).

The language itself is *similiar* in some respects to BASIC but also has some similiarities to it's parent, Java.

This guide focuses on how Velocity applies towards writing Newlife content and assumes that you have a general working knowledge of programming (You understand what conditionals are, you understand what a loop is, and so forth).
It does *not* assume that you know Velocity or Java.

# Velocity

// overview of Velocity, touching on macros, derectives, data types, conditionals, loops... the basics 
//  this is primarily in case Apache's reference goes dark at some future point

// data types should also show the internal class names (that you can check against using the .class property)
// the concept of casting should probably be touched upon.

## Tricks and Tips

// This section will go over tricks and tips and also how to deal with some of Velocity's many idiosyncrasies
